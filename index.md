# Description
The VIP Microrobotics Embryo Image Analysis subteam is dedicated to work on analyzing embryo videos to predict which embryos will lead to the highest success rate for in-vitro fertilization. 

The team has successfully utilized the UNET architecture in MATLAB to obtain a neural network that predicts human embryos with a mean IoU of ~95%. Currently, there are MATLAB scripts to augment images in order to obtain a larger dataset and a MATLAB stand-alone application that end-user's can use for embryo analysis using the developed neural network.

The team is working on translating all of the existing MATLAB scripts into Python scripts to allow users without a MATLAB license to access the code.
