# Description
The VIP Microrobotics Embryo Image Analysis subteam is dedicated to work on analyzing embryo videos to predict which embryos will lead to the highest success rate for in-vitro fertilization. 

The team has successfully utilized the UNET architecture in MATLAB to obtain a neural network that predicts human embryos with a mean IoU of ~95%. Currently, there are MATLAB scripts to augment images in order to obtain a larger dataset and a MATLAB stand-alone application that end-user's can use for embryo analysis using the developed neural network.

The team was also successful in translating all of the existing MATLAB scripts into Python scripts to allow users without a MATLAB license to access the code.

# Ongoing Projects

## Python Embryo Analysis Application Development, Spring 2021 - Current
*Goal:* To create a stand-alone application in Python to easily process videos using the trained UNET neural network.

*Result:* A Python application was developed using Python TKinter. The application can be installed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1wc-yvcfffQpePBkfdjm6qq2cUrNeZFMj). You can also download the application via the link below:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1wc-yvcfffQpePBkfdjm6qq2cUrNeZFMj
```
The source repository for the application can be found [here](https://github.com/VIPEmbryoImageAnalysis/embryo-analysis-application/tree/tkinter-python), or by copying the following link into your web browser:

# Past Projects

## Python Translation, Fall 2019 - Fall 2020
*Goal:* To transfer the code from MATLAB scripts into Python to allow an open-source access to our code.

*Result:* Most of the code has been successfully transferred from MATLAB to Python. One set of scripts for network training that are available in our repository can use labeled data from LabelMe (JSON). The other set of scripts for network training can use MATLAB labeled data (PNG) as well as other forms such as JPG, JPEG, and BMP. The code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/VIPEmbryoImageAnalysis/network-training/tree/master/Python), or by copying the following link into your web browser:

```

## MATLAB Embryo Analysis Application, Spring 2020
*Goal:* Create a standalone application to process embryo videos using the UNET neural network trained. 

*Result:* A MATLAB application developed using App Designer was successfully developed. The application installer can be installed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LD3cDBIbPlYZ5EVDTsal68xdpcRWVNni). You can also download the installer via the link below:
