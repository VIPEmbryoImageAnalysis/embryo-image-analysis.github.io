# Description
The VIP Microrobotics Embryo Image Analysis subteam is dedicated to work on analyzing embryo videos to predict which embryos will lead to the highest success rate for in-vitro fertilization. 

The team has successfully utilized the UNET architecture in MATLAB to obtain a neural network that predicts human embryos with a mean IoU of ~95%. Currently, there are MATLAB scripts to augment images in order to obtain a larger dataset and a MATLAB stand-alone application that end-user's can use for embryo analysis using the developed neural network.

The team is working on translating all of the existing MATLAB scripts into Python scripts to allow users without a MATLAB license to access the code.

# Ongoing Projects

## Python Translation, Fall 2019 - Current
*Goal:* To transfer the code from MATLAB scripts into Python to allow an open-source access to our code.

*In-Progress:* Most of the code has been successfully transferred to Python. The script for network training is still being processed. The code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/VIPEmbryoImageAnalysis/network-training/tree/master/Python), or by copying the following link into your web browser:

```


## MATLAB Embryo Analysis Application, Spring 2020
*Goal:* Create a standalone application to process embryo videos using the UNET neural network trained. 

*Result:* A MATLAB application developed using App Designer was successfully developed. The application installer can be installed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LD3cDBIbPlYZ5EVDTsal68xdpcRWVNni). You can also download the installer via the link below:
```

```

*How to Use:*
1) Install the [installer](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LD3cDBIbPlYZ5EVDTsal68xdpcRWVNni)
2) Download the application
3) Select videos
4) Choose videos to use (or delete)
5) Analyze results
6) Observe the results
7) Save results
